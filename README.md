### Logistic-Regression-Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
The case study aims to assign lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

Built a logistic regression model that assigned a lead score between 0-100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target Hot Leads and reported the strong factors behind lead conversion rate or potential customers using Mixed-Modelling Approach resulting in a model with 80% accuracy and 74% sensitivity at cut-off 0.365 by analyzing around 9000 data points that had 30% converted data.
